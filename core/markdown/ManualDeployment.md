### Resource provisioning (manual)

1. Login to the VM whose IP address is **{Outputs.virtualMachineIP}** using the user name and password you specified during deployment. Typically this is done via RDP, but feel free to use your own preferred client. If you do use RDP, you can either open up RDP and enter the IP address, or double click the .RDP file. You can download the .RDP file by clicking [here]({Outputs.virtualMachinePortalUri}) and then clicking **Connect**.
1. From the VM, double click the shortcut **Setup - Data Virtualization** on the desktop and wait for the script to finish. It typically takes about 10-12 minutes to run.

Leave your client session open for the final step where we take it for a spin.
